#+TITLE: Xpra TODO
* TODO Do the startup-complete window-preservation idea (ON HOLD)
  The idea is - if a connection is lost, windows/nitpicker connections aren't destroyed.
  The only difficulty is that Windows hold references to some shared sessions/types held in the Client object.
  If the client object is destroyed (on disconnect), then these are also destroyed.
